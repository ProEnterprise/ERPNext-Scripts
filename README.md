## Weighted Barcode
Weighted Barcode Script allows scanning of scale printed weight barcode into the POS. Replace your pos.js file and customise it according [these instructions](https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/how-can-mange-barcode-for-weighted-items-in-pos/20066/) to suit your barcode format.

1. Get this [pos.js file](https://github.com/dawoodjee/ERPNext-Scripts/blob/master/pos.js)

2. Then replace `pos.js` here `~/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext/erpnext/accounts/page/pos/pos.js`

OR just copy and paste everything within `pos.js`.

## Compatibility
* Tested with ERPNext v7.x to v10.x.
* Works best on Firefox browser. Theres an issue on Google Chrome.
